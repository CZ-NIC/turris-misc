You can choose from one of these branches:
  deploy
    Default and most stable branch. Suggested for unexperienced users.
  rc
    Release candidate. This branch contains next Turris OS release. Please join
    this branch to help us test next release. It's more stable than daily but it
    can contain bugs.
  daily
    This branch is same as nightly except it is updated only when automatic
    tests are successful. Should be more stable than nightly but manual
    intervention might be sometimes required too.
  nightly
    Branch built every night containing latest software. Suggested only for
    experienced users as it's sometimes broken and requires manual intervention.
  test
    Branch used during development. It's often broken. It's usage is highly
    discouraged.
